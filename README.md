# Drawing-Numbers

A machine learning project which will guess a number based on the input of the
user, built with keras and tkinter

## How to Use:

simply run the main.py script, it will automatically open a tkinter window to draw numbers

```
cd directory\of\project\Drawing-Numbers\python
python .\main.py
```

## How does it work:

The neural network was trained using the mnist dataset of handwritten numbers,
and it seems to have an accuracy of over 90% within that dataset, this accuracy may decrease on actual numbers
